name: Vanessa Whittaker
about: |
  I have worked in education and health all my career. I trained in early years
  and secondary education in the mid 80’s and as an antenatal teacher with
  the National Childbirth Trust in the early 90’s and then a psychodynamic
  counsellor. I went on to train and work as a midwife for 20 years. As a
  community midwife for 10 years I was very involved with supporting women
  postnatally as this is an area I feel is neglected. I also completed a 2 year
  infant observation with the West Midland Institute of Psychotherapy which
  helped deepen my understanding of how baby’s develop within their
  families.

  Families need support at this time of huge transition and Mum’s mental
  health is so much stronger with good support. This in turn helps babies form
  secure attachments and helps with physical and emotional development.
  The whole family function better with good support.

  In 2017 I left the NHS and now work offering postnatal support including
  breastfeeding support, baby massage sessions, baby yoga sessions and
  postnatal massage for Mum’s.

  I have lived in bear wood for 33 years and love supporting this great
  community. I work from Lightwoods House in Bearwood and offer massage
  from a bespoke room at home.

  I can also offer private or small group sessions in your own home.
  I have 2 grown up children, love walking, gardening, yoga and keep
  chickens!
