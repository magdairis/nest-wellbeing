name: Vanessa Whittaker
about: |
  I have worked in education and health throughout my career, starting with early years
  and secondary education in the 80's. In the early 90's, I trained as an antenatal teacher with
  the National Childbirth Trust and then as a psychodynamic
  counsellor. I went on to train and work as a midwife for 20 years.

  As a community midwife for 10 years I was very involved with supporting women
  postnatally as this is an area I feel is neglected. I also completed a 2 year
  infant observation with the West Midland Institute of Psychotherapy which
  deepened my understanding of how baby’s develop in their
  families.

  Families need support during this huge transition and Mum’s mental
  health is so much stronger with good support. This helps babies form
  secure attachments, and helps with physical and emotional development.
  The whole family function better with good support.

  In 2017, I left the NHS and now offer postnatal support including
  breastfeeding support, baby massage and baby yoga sessions, and
  postnatal massage for Mum’s.

  I have lived in Bearwood for 33 years and love supporting this great
  community. I work from Lightwoods House in Bearwood and give massage
  from my bespoke home studio. 

  You can also book private or small group sessions in your own home.

  I have 2 grown up children, love walking, gardening, yoga and keep
  chickens!
